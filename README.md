# Eye-Control

Virtual Reality, Real Estate

## Getting Started

Eye-Control runs as a Meteor application serving React/JSX templates.

To run, first install Meteor using their rather untrustworthy instructions:

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

Then, start the Eye-Control server:

    meteor

The dependency packages will be automatically loaded, and the server will then be available at localhost:3000.

Routes for the different pages can be found in lib/router.jsx
